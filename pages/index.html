    <h4>A LOOK INTO WEB DEVELOPMENT</h4>
     <p>## Front-End Development::

       Front-end development involves building the part of the website that users interact with,
       including the layout, design, and functionality.
       HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the primary languages used in front-end development.
       HTML provides the structure of the website, CSS is responsible for styling and design,
       and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and functionality to the website.
    </p>    

    <p>## Back-End Development::

        Back-end development involves building the server side of the website,
        which is responsible for processing data and returning responses to the client side.
        Popular languages used in back-end development include Python, PHP, and Ruby.
        Python is a versatile and powerful language that is widely used in web development,
        data analysis, and artificial intelligence.
        One of the main advantages of Python is its simplicity and readability,
        which makes it a great language for beginners.
        It also has a large number of libraries and frameworks available,
        which can help speed up development time.</p>

    <p>## Full Stack Development::

        Full-stack development involves working on both the front-end and back-end of the website.
        This requires knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies,
        as well as the ability to integrate them seamlessly.
        Full-stack developers are in high demand, as they can build and maintain entire web applications from
        start to finish.
        JavaScript is a high-level programming language used for creating interactive front-end web applications
        and building server-side applications. It works well with other web technologies, such as HTML and CSS,
        and has a large number of libraries and frameworks available, such as React and AngularJS.</p>
